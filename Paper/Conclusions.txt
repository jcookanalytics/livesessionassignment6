Conclusion

 from this study of Staten Island, New York properties 
sold in the last 12 months, we were able to establish a visual 
correlation in family homes between the sale price and the gross 
square footage on both a Cartesian and a log-log scales.  Further 
analysis (least squares lines) would be needed to determine which 
relationship is better (i.e., has a higher correlation coefficient).

From further analysis of the data, we observed outliers existing
in homes sold for less than $100,000 and homes with less than 100 sqft.
A visual correlation seems to exist between the sale price and gross
living square footage. Delving further into the data, we separated out
the data by building class category types (one, two, and three family homes).
From the scatter plot that is grouped by building category (ggplot function),
there appears to be differences in observation densities per building
category. Due to overplotting of the data points, we separated out each 
building class category groups into it's own scatter plot. Next, we
calculated the correlation coefficients per building category with the 
following results:

One family dwelling homes: 0.69
Two family dwelling homes: 0.55
Three family dwelling homes 0.63

A linear relationship appears to exist even when separating the data by 
building category.

Digging further into the analysis, we wanted to check if there were any
patterns in regards to sale prices versus zip codes per building class
category. From all three box plots for the three building class category,
the following conclusion was generated.The lowest mean sale price for one 
and two family dwelling homes was zip code 10303. Zip code 10302 has the 
lowest mean sale price for three family dwelling homes. For the highest 
mean sale prices for each one, two and three family homes,all zip codes 
were different; 10309, 10307, and 10306, respectively.
